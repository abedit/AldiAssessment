# Aldi Assessment

This is an assessment for the Mobile App Developer position at Aldi SÃ¼d. The repository is public for now but will make it private should the Aldi team request me to do so.

A brief summary of the app:
- Load a list of the top 10 ranked coins from the [CoinCap REST API](https://docs.coincap.io/)
- Upon clicking on an list item, display more details about the Coin
- The data are to be refresh automatically every 60 seconds
- The app must follow the screen designs provided.

## Notes
- The coins are already sorted in ascending order according to [https://docs.coincap.io](https://docs.coincap.io/) and there was an option to send a parameter to the API to limit the results to 10. No sorting or truncation was needed from the app side.

- I implemented a snackbar that shows up if trying to load the list if the API call is not successful.

- I added a swipe to refresh mechanism in the list view.

- The SVGs from figma weren't working, as if the extracted svg was malformed. Since i refused to import them as pngs, I downloaded the biggest PNG size, imported them in Illustrator and used its image trace to generate an SVG. I admit it's not an elegant solution. In a real scenario, I would have asked the designer for help.

- If the icon is not present in figma, the "Blur On" icon from [Material Symbols & Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) is used as default.
